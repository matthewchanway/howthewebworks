Part One

HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources and documents, it allows browsers and servers to communicate.
A URL is the address of a web page, made up of several components.
A DNS is a system that turns domain names into IP addresses
A query string is text in the URL that is passed to the server, it has a use, often to change pages.
GET and POST are two HTTP verbs - GET requests without changing data on the server side, POST requests and does change on the 
server side.
An HTTP request is a message sent by the client to initiate action on the server-side.
An HTTP response should provide the client with the resource it requested, or inform the client of an errors, or
inform the client the requested action has been carried out.
An HTTP header is a name or value pair that is displayed in request and response messages of message header for HTTP.
They pass additional information between the client and server.
http://somesite.com/some/page.html when you type into browser:
Your browser will look up the IP address for the domain (somesite.com)
The browser will initiate a connection with the server - either a TCP (transmission control protocol), or a 
content delivery network. The browswer will send an HTTP request to the server, and the server will processes
that request and respond. Once your browser has received that response from the server, it can render whatever content has been 
sent (hopefully the webpage, but possibly an error message).
